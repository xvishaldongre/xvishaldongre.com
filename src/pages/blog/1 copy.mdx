I have to set up a MacBook Pro fairly often - when starting a new job and when buying a new personal computer. I created this article back in 2015 when I got my first Mac and have been updating it ever since with whatever I need as my job evolves. I'm primarily a full-stack web developer, so most of my needs will revolve around JavaScript/Node.js.

# Getting Started
The setup assistant will launch once you turn the computer on. Enter your language, time zone, Apple ID, and so on. The first thing you should do is update macOS to get the latest security updates and patches.

- Install apps via Homebrew
- Shell setup with zsh
- Set up Node via nvm
- Set up git config
- Set up SSH keys and config
- macOS settings
- Application settings

## Homebrew
Install the Homebrew package manager. This will allow you to install almost any app from the command line.
```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

Make sure everything is up to date.
`brew update`

## Installed Apps
Here are a few shell programs I always use:
| Shell Program | Purpose           |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| git           | Version Control   |
| exa           | `ls` aleternative |

```
